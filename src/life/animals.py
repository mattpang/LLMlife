# there should be a base class of BodyPlan, which can have bipedal, 4 legged or no limbs i.e a snake. 
# these have abilties which end up calculating their speed, and metabolic intake etc. 
# i.e 2 legs use less energy than 4, but are slower.
# extend the bodyplan to include other parts, such as jaw / teeth , protection: armour plating etc etc.
# animals may have senses which enable to find food or look out for danger. sight or smells. 
# these should give a balanced set. 
# stats should be calculated based on these parts, to give attack, defence and speed etc attributes.
