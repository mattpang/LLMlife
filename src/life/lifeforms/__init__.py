# lifeforms live in this folder. we inheient the BodyPlan class and seed initial chractoristics.
# first set out the herbivores,
# we want to have them breed and simulate living amongst eachother.
# so there should always be some predator types.
# each lifeform should have a .move() interface.
# the code for seeking out food and hunting (if applicable) is here. The complexity of
# these instructions determine their metabolic intake, so complex code needs more food input
#
# Examples
#
# lifeforms without senses might just blindly move
#
# some lifeforms can breed on their own, the advantage of sexual breeding would be greater
# variations of inate stats that could be passed onto the next generation.
# if a lifeform has found a partner, then they can run the .breed() function.
# when they start breeding they must make a nest and be stationary.
